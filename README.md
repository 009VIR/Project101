# 📊 Project101 — SPY OHLC Visualization

This project demonstrates how to fetch and visualize 1-year OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for the SPY ETF using Python, `yfinance`, and `matplotlib`. It follows a modular and professional structure suitable for quant research workflows, version-controlled via Git.
